*A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall*是美国国宝级歌手，诗人，诺贝尔文学奖得主Bob Dylan的名曲之一，虽然原唱说不上多么好听，但是歌词很有意境，分享如下：
> A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall
> 
> Bob Dylan
> 
> Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
> 
> Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
> 
> I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
> 
> I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
> 
> I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
> 
> I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
> 
> I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
> 
> And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
> And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
> 
> Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
> 
> Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
> 
> I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
> 
> I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
> 
> I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
> 
> I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
> 
> I saw a white ladder all covered with water
> 
> I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
> 
> I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
> 
> And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
> 
> And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
> 
> And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
> 
> And what did you hear, my darling young one?
> 
> I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
> 
> Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
> 
> Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
> 
> Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
> 
> Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
> 
> And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
> 
> And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
> 
> Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
> 
> Who did you meet, my darling young one?
> 
> I met a young child beside a dead pony
> 
> I met a white man who walked a black dog
> 
> I met a young woman whose body was burning
> 
> I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
> 
> I met one man who was wounded in love
> 
> I met another man who was wounded with hatred
> 
> And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
> 
> It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
> 
> Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
> 
> Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
> 
> I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
> 
> I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
> 
> Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
> 
> Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
> 
> Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
> 
> Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden
> 
> Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
> 
> Where black is the color, where none is the number
> 
> And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
> 
> And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
> 
> Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
> 
> But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
> 
> And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
> 
> It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
